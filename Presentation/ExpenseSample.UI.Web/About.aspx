        About Layered Architecture Sample
    </h2>
<p>Layered Architecture Sample is designed to demonstrate how to apply various .NET
Technologies such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Form, ASP.NET and ADO.NET
Entity Framework to the Layered Architecture Design Pattern. It is aimed at 
illustrating how code of similar responsibilities can be factored into multiple 
logical layers which are applicable in most of today's enterprise applications. 
</p>
<p>
The primary objective of the sample is to focus on layering and therefore, certain 
cross-cutting functionalities have been omitted to maintain its simplicity.
